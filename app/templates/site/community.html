                                An important facet is the education of parents, relatives and community to facilitate
                                the process of integration and inclusion of the children and youth in their social
                                community. To involve the community, families of children attending the school put in
                                work hours by helping attend to the children, building, and upkeep of the Centre. This
                                has resulted in the communities becoming vested in the Centre. It also provides the
                                necessary contact with parents and extended family to provide training and support. The
                                Centre is also used for community events thus becoming an integral part of the community
                                at large.
